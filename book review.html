<h3 class="book-title"> Emma by Jane Austen </h3>
<p class="author">Jane Austen </p>

<p" class="rating">★★★★★</p>
<p class="review">The novel revolves around Emma, a well-meaning but disaster-prone matchmaker, who ignores her own romantic feelings while setting out to find a suitor for her friend Harriet. Her efforts cause more problems than solutions as she leaves a trail of mishaps behind her. As her plans go awry, Emma realizes that she herself may be the one in love. The book is a classic exploration of social manners, love, and marriage in 19th-century England.
